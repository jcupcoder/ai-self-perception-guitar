## Methodology

1. Each model was asked the same base prompt.
2. Follow-up clarification questions were allowed only if needed.
3. No song constraints were imposed (genre, difficulty, era).
4. Performances were interpreted faithfully, not optimized for difficulty.
5. Screenshots were captured to preserve response integrity.

The goal is *interpretive honesty*, not musical perfection.
